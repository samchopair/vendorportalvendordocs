# Vendor Dashboard

**Navigation**: [Home](../README.md) > [Vendor Documentation](./README.md) > Dashboard

## Overview

The Vendor Dashboard is your home base in the Vendor Portal. It provides a comprehensive overview of your product submissions, batch status, and recent activity. The dashboard is designed to give you quick insights into your submission performance and easy access to your most important tasks.

When you sign in to the Vendor Portal, you'll land on the dashboard, which displays real-time statistics about your products and batches.

## Key Concepts

Before diving into the dashboard features, understand these key concepts:

- **Products Submitted**: The total number of products you've uploaded to the portal across all batches
- **Approved Products**: Products that have been reviewed and accepted by administrators
- **Pending Products**: Products currently awaiting administrator review or in draft status
- **Rejected Products**: Products that were not accepted and require correction
- **Batches**: Collections of products uploaded together via Excel files
- **Batch Status**: The current state of a batch (Pending, Approved, or Rejected)

## Dashboard Components

### Welcome Header

At the top of the dashboard, you'll see a personalized welcome message:

- Your name (if provided in your profile)
- Your organization name
- A brief overview message

This helps you confirm you're signed in with the correct account.

### Statistics Cards

Four prominent cards at the top of the dashboard display your key metrics:

#### Products Submitted

- **What it shows**: Total number of products you've uploaded across all time
- **Icon**: Trending up arrow
- **Purpose**: Gives you a sense of your overall submission volume
- **Includes**: All products regardless of status (approved, pending, rejected, draft)

#### Approved

- **What it shows**: Number of products that have been approved by administrators
- **Icon**: Check circle
- **Color**: Green accent
- **Purpose**: Shows how many of your products have been successfully accepted
- **Note**: Approved products are ready for synchronization

#### Pending Review

- **What it shows**: Number of products currently awaiting administrator review
- **Icon**: Clock
- **Color**: Yellow/secondary
- **Purpose**: Indicates how many products are in the review queue
- **Includes**: Products with "pending" or "draft" status

#### Rejected

- **What it shows**: Number of products that were not accepted
- **Icon**: Alert circle
- **Color**: Red
- **Purpose**: Highlights products that need correction and resubmission
- **Action**: Click through to view rejection feedback and make corrections

### Understanding Your Statistics

**Interpreting the Numbers**:

- **High approval rate** (Approved / Total): Indicates good data quality and adherence to requirements
- **High pending count**: Normal after recent uploads; check back in 24-48 hours
- **High rejection count**: Review rejection feedback carefully to understand common issues

**Example Scenario**:
- Products Submitted: 150
- Approved: 120
- Pending Review: 20
- Rejected: 10

This shows an 80% approval rate (120/150), which is good. The 20 pending products are likely from a recent upload, and the 10 rejected products need attention.

## My Batches Section

The My Batches section shows your recent batch submissions and provides quick access to batch details.

### Batch List Display

Each batch in the list shows:

- **Batch Number**: Unique identifier (e.g., "BATCH-2024-001")
- **Status Badge**: Visual indicator of batch status
  - 🟢 **Approved** (Green): Batch has been accepted
  - 🟡 **Pending** (Yellow): Awaiting administrator review
  - 🔴 **Rejected** (Red): Batch was not accepted
- **Filename**: Original Excel file name you uploaded
- **Product Count**: Number of products in the batch
- **Upload Time**: How long ago the batch was uploaded (e.g., "2 hours ago", "1 day ago")

### Pending Batches Badge

If you have batches awaiting review, you'll see a badge showing:

- **"X Pending"**: Number of batches currently in pending status
- **Purpose**: Quick visual reminder of batches awaiting review
- **Action**: Click on pending batches to view details

### Batch Actions

**View All Button**:
- Located in the top-right of the My Batches section
- Click to navigate to the full Batches page
- Shows all your batches with advanced filtering options

- A friendly message: "No batches yet"
- Explanation: "Upload your first batch to get started"
- **Upload Products** button to begin your first upload

## Status Distribution Chart

The Status Distribution chart provides a visual representation of your product statuses.

### Chart Type

- **Pie Chart**: Shows proportional breakdown of product statuses
- **Color-Coded Segments**:
  - **Green**: Approved products
  - **Yellow**: Pending products
  - **Red**: Rejected products

### How to Read the Chart

- **Larger segments**: Indicate more products in that status
- **Hover over segments**: See exact numbers and percentages
- **Balanced chart**: Ideally, you want a large green (approved) segment

### What the Chart Tells You

**Healthy Distribution**:
- Large green segment (approved)
- Small yellow segment (pending - recent uploads)
- Minimal red segment (rejected)

**Needs Attention**:
- Large red segment: Review rejection feedback and improve data quality
- Large yellow segment persisting: May indicate review backlog or issues

**Empty Chart**:
- If you have no products yet, you'll see: "No products to display"
- Upload your first batch to populate the chart

## Quick Stats Panel

The Quick Stats panel provides a summary of key metrics in an easy-to-read format.

- **Purpose**: Quick reference for your overall submission volume

#### Approval Rate

**Interpreting Approval Rate**:

## Dashboard Best Practices

### Regular Monitoring

- **Check daily**: Review your dashboard at least once per day during active submission periods
- **Monitor pending count**: If pending products remain for more than 48 hours, consider following up
- **Track approval rate**: Aim to maintain an approval rate above 80%

### Understanding Trends

- **Increasing rejections**: Review your data preparation process and common rejection reasons
- **Consistent approvals**: Your process is working well - maintain your standards
- **Growing pending queue**: May indicate high submission volume or review backlog

### Taking Action

**When you see high rejections**:
1. Review rejection feedback for patterns
2. Identify common issues (missing fields, incorrect formats, etc.)
3. Improve your data preparation process
4. Consider smaller test batches to validate changes

**When you see pending batches**:
1. Wait 24-48 hours for initial review
2. Check notifications for any requests from administrators
3. Ensure you're available to respond to questions

**When you see approved products**:
1. Note what worked well in those submissions
2. Apply the same standards to future uploads
3. Maintain consistent data quality

## Status Indicators Reference

### Batch Status Badges

| **Approved** | Green | Batch accepted | Products will be synced |

## Time Indicators

The dashboard uses relative time indicators to show when actions occurred:

- **"Just now"**: Within the last minute
- **"X minutes ago"**: Within the last hour
- **"X hours ago"**: Within the last 24 hours
- **"X days ago"**: More than 24 hours ago

This helps you quickly understand the recency of updates without checking exact timestamps.

## Dashboard Loading States

### Initial Load

When you first navigate to the dashboard:

- You'll see a loading spinner with "Loading dashboard data..."
- This typically takes 1-2 seconds
- The dashboard will populate with your data once loaded

### Error States

If there's an issue loading dashboard data:

- You'll see an error message with details
- Try refreshing the page
- If the issue persists, contact your administrator

If you're a new vendor with no data:

- Statistics cards will show "0" for all metrics
- My Batches will show "No batches yet" with an upload button
- Charts will show "No products to display"
- Recent Activity will show "No recent activity"

This is normal for new accounts - start by uploading your first batch!
