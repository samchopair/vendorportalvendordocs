## Key Concepts

Before submitting products, familiarize yourself with these important concepts:

### Products

Individual items you submit for approval:

- Each product has basic information (name, SKU, description)
- Products have attributes (color, size, material, etc.)
- Products are assigned to categories
- Products go through an approval workflow

### Batches

A collection of products uploaded together via Excel file:

- Each upload creates a new batch
- Batches have a unique batch number
- Batches are reviewed and approved/rejected as a whole
- You can track batch status from submission to approval

### Excel Templates

Pre-formatted Excel files for uploading products:

- Templates are generated based on selected categories and attributes
- Templates have protected headers to prevent errors
- You fill in product data in the template rows
- Templates ensure data is in the correct format

### Categories

Hierarchical classification system for organizing products:

- Products must be assigned to a category
- Categories are synced from Catsy
- You select categories when building templates
- Categories help organize and classify your products

### Attributes

Product characteristics or properties:

- Attributes define what information you can provide (e.g., Color, Size, Material)
- Some attributes are required, others are optional
- Available attributes depend on your organization's permissions
- Attributes are selected when building templates

### Attribute Groups

Collections of related attributes:

- Your administrator assigns attribute groups to your organization
- Attribute groups control which attributes you can use
- Different vendors may have access to different attribute groups
- Helps organize attributes by product type or vendor needs

### Validation

Automatic checking of your uploaded data:

- The system validates your data when you upload
- Validation checks for required fields, data formats, and business rules
- Validation errors must be fixed before submission
- Preview screen shows validation results

### Approval Workflow

The process your products go through:

1. **Upload** - You upload products via Excel
2. **Pending** - Products await admin review
3. **Review** - Admin reviews your batch
4. **Approved/Rejected** - Admin makes a decision
5. **Catsy Sync** - Approved products sync to Catsy (done by admin)

## Quick Start: Submitting Your First Products

Follow these steps to submit your first batch of products:

### Step 1: Build an Excel Template

See [Template Builder](./template-builder.md) for detailed instructions.

### Step 2: Fill in the Template

## Common First-Time Questions

### How long does batch review take?

Typically 24-48 hours during business days. You'll receive a notification when your batch is reviewed.

### What happens if my batch is rejected?

You'll receive a notification with feedback from the administrator. Review the feedback, correct the issues, and upload a new batch with the corrected data.

### Can I edit products after uploading?

No, once uploaded, products cannot be edited directly. If you need to make changes, you'll need to upload a new batch with the corrected information.

### How many products can I upload at once?

There's no strict limit, but we recommend batches of 50-100 products for easier management and faster review.

### What if I make a mistake in the template?

If you catch it before uploading, simply fix it in Excel and save. If you've already uploaded, you can upload a new batch with corrections.

### Can I use Google Sheets or LibreOffice?

While these tools can open Excel files, we strongly recommend using Microsoft Excel for best results. Some features may not work correctly in other applications.
